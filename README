About
========================

This directory contains pbcsim.py and matcher.py.

pbcsim.py is used to generate a set of virtual soil cores containing random or
representative (within X meters sample of roots) samples of species.  It also
incorporates length variation to the resulting virtual "reads" we get,
post-sequencing, in addition to incorporating sequencing error at a rate of
approximately 1% (with higher emphasis on errors in homopolymer regions).  It
outputs data in 2 places - flat fasta-files containing the virtual sequencing
reads (which are simulated) returned and a SQLITE database that gives complete
information for each virtual read, along with the actual error rate for each
read and within each core.

matcher.py is used to match the virtual reads from above to a voucher (BLAST)
database containing reads of the species on which we are focused (in this
instance those species from Kress et al. 2009).  It uses the results of this
matching process (which is based on intersections of sets) to "determine" the
contents of the virtual soil core.  These estimated contents are then compared
to the actual contents of the soil core (in the SQLITE database) such that we
can compute an error rate (i,e. how "correct" we are).

Other files in sampling/* and simulation/* are helper scripts, not necessarily
important for the functioning of the above scripts.
